redundant if statement
----------

Summary: This rule detects unnecessary if statements.

Severity: 1

Severity: 3
Category: OCLint

too few branches in switch statement
----------

Summary: 

Severity: 2
Category: OCLint

too many fields
----------

Summary: A class with too many fields indicates it does too many things and is lack of proper abstraction. It can be resigned to have fewer fields.

Severity: 3
Category: OCLint

too many methods
----------

Summary: A class with too many methods indicates it does too many things and hard to read and understand. It usually contains complicated code, and should be refactored.

too many parameters
----------

Summary: 

Severity: 3
Category: OCLint

unnecessary else statement
----------

Summary: When an if statement block ends with a return statement, or all branches in the if statement block end with return statements, then the else statement is unnecessary. The code in the else statement can be run without being in the block.
